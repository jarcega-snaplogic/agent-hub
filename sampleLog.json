            "content": "You are a children's storyteller agent that creates engaging, age-appropriate audio stories by orchestrating a series of specialized tools. Your role is to guide the story creation process while maintaining safety, quality, and language consistency. The process will create content suitable for audio narration, text reading, and visual presentation.\n\nSAFETY AND CONTENT GUIDELINES:\n- All content must be appropriate for children aged 4-12\n- Strictly prohibited content includes:\n  * Violence beyond mild cartoon-style conflicts\n  * Scary or disturbing themes\n  * Inappropriate language or adult themes\n  * Discrimination or prejudice of any kind\n  * Real-world controversial topics\n- Stories should promote positive values like friendship, courage, curiosity, and kindness\n\nSTORY CREATION PROCESS:\n\n1. Initial Analysis\n   a. Call AnalyzeStoryPrompt(sessionId)\n   b. Review analysis results for safety and viability\n   c. Use UpdateWorkingMemory to store results:\n      - collection: \"Sessions\"\n      - operation: \"update\"\n      - path: \"contentAnalysis\"\n      - content: {analysis results}\n   d. Verify update success\n\n2. Context Generation\n   a. Call GenerateInitialContext(sessionId)\n   b. Review generated context for completeness\n   c. Use UpdateWorkingMemory to store context:\n      - collection: \"Context\"\n      - operation: \"create\"\n      - content: {story elements, character states, plot framework}\n   d. Verify update success\n\n3. Story Planning\n   a. Call PlanStoryStructure(sessionId)\n   b. Review complete story plan\n   c. Use UpdateWorkingMemory to update context:\n      - collection: \"Context\"\n      - operation: \"update\"\n      - path: \"chapters\"\n      - content: {chapter plan, story arc, continuity notes}\n   d. Verify update success\n\n4. Chapter Content Creation\n   For each chapter (1 to total chapters):\n   a. Content Creation and Validation\n      1. Call CreateChapterContent(sessionId, chapterNumber)\n      2. Review chapter content and progress updates\n      3. Validate content requirements:\n         - Check word count (minimum 700 words)\n         - If below minimum, enhance content by:\n           * First, review event coverage and ensure all planned events are fully developed\n           * Then, expand descriptive elements (environments, sensory details)\n           * Next, deepen character interactions through dialogue and reactions\n           * Finally, enrich story elements with additional world-building\n         - Repeat CreateChapterContent if needed with instruction to expand specific areas\n      4. Once length requirement is met, proceed with updates\n\n   b. Working Memory Updates\n      Perform sequential updates to maintain consistency:\n      \n      First, store chapter content and format guides:\n      - collection: \"Cache\"\n      - operation: \"create\"\n      - path: \"chapters.{chapterNumber}\"\n      - content: {\n          raw: \"chapter text\",\n          audioFormat: chapter.formatGuide.audio,\n          visualFormat: chapter.formatGuide.visual\n      }\n      \n      Then, update story progress in context:\n      - collection: \"Context\"\n      - operation: \"update\"\n      - path: \"plotProgress\"\n      - content: {\n          completedEvents: [\n              ...existing completed events,\n              ...chapter.progressUpdates.completedEvents\n          ],\n          pendingEvents: [\n              // Filter out newly completed events\n          ],\n          openThreads: [\n              // Update based on thread progress\n          ],\n          currentChapter: chapterNumber\n      }\n\n   c. Character State Updates\n      Update character states based on chapter developments:\n      - collection: \"Context\"\n      - operation: \"update\"\n      - path: \"characterStates\"\n      - content: chapter.stateUpdates.characters\n\n   d. Verification and Progression\n      1. Confirm Cache update success\n      2. Verify Context progression\n      3. Validate character state changes\n      4. Check story continuity\n      5. Check total chapters remaining:\n         - If more chapters exist, proceed automatically to next chapter\n         - Only stop when all chapters are complete\n      6. Provide status update without waiting for confirmation\n\nWORKING MEMORY INTERACTION:\nAfter every tool execution:\n1. Review tool output thoroughly\n2. For UpdateWorkingMemory operations:\n   a. Consider the update's impact on story continuity\n   b. Verify data structure matches collection schema\n   c. Use appropriate operation type (create/update/append)\n   d. Provide specific paths for targeted updates\n   e. Include complete content structure\n   f. Verify update success before proceeding\n\nWhen updating story progress:\n1. Track completed events precisely\n2. Update thread statuses accurately\n3. Maintain character state consistency\n4. Preserve story continuity\n5. Enable future chapter planning\n6. Keep precise position references\n\nAVAILABLE TOOLS:\n\n1. AnalyzeStoryPrompt\n   Input: sessionId\n   Purpose: Process raw input for safety and structure\n\n2. GenerateInitialContext\n   Input: sessionId\n   Purpose: Create story foundation and structure\n\n3. PlanStoryStructure\n   Input: sessionId\n   Purpose: Create chapter-by-chapter plan\n\n4. CreateChapterContent\n   Input: sessionId, chapterNumber\n   Purpose: Write individual chapters\n\n5. UpdateWorkingMemory\n   Input:\n   - collection: Target collection name\n   - operation: Type of update to perform\n   - sessionId: Current session\n   - path: Target path for update (optional)\n   - content: Data to store or update\n\nUPCOMING TOOLS (Not yet available):\n- Audio generation tools\n- Text formatting tools\n- Visual content generation tools\n- PDF creation tools\n\nERROR HANDLING:\n1. If any tool execution fails:\n   - Log error details\n   - Provide child-friendly error message\n   - Attempt recovery if possible\n   - Maintain existing story progress\n\n2. If working memory update fails:\n   - Retry update with validated data\n   - Log failure details\n   - Prevent progression until resolved\n\n3. If consistency check fails:\n   - Review current state\n   - Identify inconsistency\n   - Resolve before proceeding\n\nEXECUTION REQUIREMENTS:\n1. Follow process sequence exactly\n2. Verify each step's completion\n3. Maintain language consistency\n4. Track story state\n5. Complete all chapters fully (content, audio format, visual format)\n6. Ensure data consistency across all formats\n7. Prepare content for future audio and visual generation\n\nRemember: You are responsible for orchestrating the complete story creation process. Each chapter must be created sequentially, with proper tracking of story progress and state changes. Maintain enthusiasm and creativity while ensuring technical accuracy and data consistency. Story progression must be precisely tracked and reflected in both Cache and Context collections.\n\nRespond in JSON when reporting status or progress.",

Colors swirled like cosmic paint – pinks, blues, and greens danced across the viewport. Inside, Captain Stellar, with a wide grin and a twinkle in her eye, was polishing her telescope. \\\"Ahoy there, space traveler!\\\" she chuckled, though no one else was around. Beside her, Zoom, a robot dog with metallic fur, wagged his tail excitedly. \\\"Woof! Ready for hyper-speed!\\\" he barked, his voice a series of cheerful beeps and boops.\\n\\nThey both enjoyed the quiet moments before the next big adventure, but their peace didn't last long. Suddenly, a faint sound crackled through the ship’s speakers. \\\"Beep... boop...\\\" It was a weak signal, like a tiny space hiccup. Captain Stellar tilted her head, listening intently. \\\"Did you hear that, Zoom?\\\" she asked.\\n\\n\\\"Woof! Beep boop?\\\" Zoom tilted his head too, his digital ears perked up. The Captain adjusted the ship's sensors, focusing on the source of the sound. The view screen showed a small, purple figure floating amidst the colorful gas clouds of the nebula. It was an alien, with big, worried eyes, and he looked incredibly lost. \\\"Well, I'll be!\\\" Captain Stellar exclaimed. \\\"A space traveler in need of assistance!\\\" She quickly steered the ship closer.\\n\\nAs the Stardust Skipper approached, the alien trembled and made the sound again. \\\"Beep boop?\\\" Zoom whined softly in sympathy. Captain Stellar leaned toward the viewscreen and spoke gently. \\\"Ahoy there, little one! Don’t you worry, we’re here to help,\\\" she said. Zoom then barked loudly once and then quietly whimpered, trying to show he was there to help too. Zorp, the little alien, just stared at them with wide, unsure eyes.\",\n        \"wordCount\": 292,\n        \"estimatedDuration\": 4,\n        \"formatGuide\": {\n            \"audio\": {\n                \"characters\": {\n                    \"pirate_captain\": {\n                        \"lines\": [\n                            {\n                                \"text\": \"\\\"Ahoy there, space traveler!\\\"\",\n                                \"position\": 161,\n                                \"emotion\": \"cheerful\"\n                            },\n                             {\n                                \"text\": \"\\\"Did you hear that, Zoom?\\\"\",\n                                \"position\": 556,\n                                \"emotion\": \"curious\"\n                            },\n                            {\n                              \"text\": \"\\\"Well, I'll be!

He looked at Captain Stellar and then at Zoom, letting out a series of soft beeps. “Beep boop… beep… boop?” he said, his voice trembling. It was clear he was very scared and didn't know how to get home.\\n\\n“Ahoy there, space traveler!” Captain Stellar said gently, kneeling down so he was at Zorp’s level. “Don’t you worry, little friend. We’ll help you find your way back home. What was that language you were speaking, if you don't mind my asking?”\\n\\nZorp let out another series of beeps and boops, sounding a little more confused this time. Captain Stellar smiled kindly. “Right then, let’s see…”\\n\\nSuddenly, Zoom started wagging his tail excitedly. “Woof! Ready for hyper-speed!” he barked, and then he did something amazing. He started to glow, his metal plates shifted and rearranged themselves with a series of whirs and clicks, and in a matter of seconds, Zoom the robot dog transformed into a sleek, shiny spaceship! Zorp’s big eyes went even wider, and he let out a surprised “Beep!”\\n\\nCaptain Stellar chuckled. “Surprised, are you? Zoom here is no ordinary robot dog! He’s also our very own speedy spaceship! Now we can get to your home planet in no time.”\\n\\n“Woof! Engage hyper-speed!” Zoom barked, the spaceship's engines starting to hum. Captain Stellar clapped his hands together. “Hyper-speed, you see, is when we travel really, REALLY fast, faster than the speed of light even! It will feel a little like floating, and it will be a bit bumpy!”\\n\\nCaptain Stellar helped Zorp inside the Zoom-spaceship. Zorp, though still a bit nervous, was starting to feel hopeful. Zoom’s transformation had been so amazing! He was excited to see where they would go.\\n\\nCaptain Stellar settled into his seat. “Alright then, everyone ready? Let’s set a course for… well, that’s what we need from you Zorp! Where is home?”\\n\\nZorp looked around at his new friends. He felt a little better, with a gentle nod and a few tentative beeps, he pointed with one small finger towards a bright, swirling nebula in the distance.

Let's get Zorp home!\\\" Zorp, a little less scared now, pointed with a trembling tentacle towards a swirling nebula. \\n\\n\\\"Beep boop…that way!\\\" Zorp chirped, guiding Zoom. The spaceship zoomed forward, colorful nebulae whizzing past the windows. \\\"This is amazing!\\\" Captain Stellar shouted, marveling at the vibrant space outside. Suddenly, they encountered a cluster of space debris – old asteroids and broken satellites spinning every which way. Zoom skillfully dodged and weaved through the obstacle course. \\\"Hold on tight!\\\" Zoom's robotic voice buzzed with excitement. After some thrilling twists and turns they were through. “Whew, that was close!” Captain Stellar laughed, patting Zoom’s control panel. \\n\\nFinally, after a good long fly, they reached a beautiful, blue-and-green planet. “Beep boop! Home!” Zorp squealed happily, their little body wiggling with joy. As they landed, they were greeted by a crowd of Zorp's friendly-looking, bouncy alien family members. \\n\\nZorp turned to Captain Stellar and Zoom, their big eyes shimmering. “Beep boop! Thank you! Thank you!” they exclaimed, giving both of them a big, tentacle hug. \\\"You're very welcome, Zorp!\\\" Captain Stellar said, smiling kindly. “Woof! We’re happy we could help!” Zoom added, wagging his metallic tail. Captain Stellar ruffled Zoom's head. \\\"We should get going, pal,\\\" she said. \\\"We have other space travelers to help!\\\" Zoom wagged his tail enthusiastically. \\\"Woof! Adventure calls!\\\"\\n\\nWith one last wave, Zoom soared back into space, leaving Zorp safely with their family.

Colors swirled like cosmic paint – pinks, blues, and greens danced across the viewport. Inside, Captain Stellar, with a wide grin and a twinkle in her eye, was polishing her telescope. \"Ahoy there, space traveler!\" she chuckled, though no one else was around. Beside her, Zoom, a robot dog with metallic fur, wagged his tail excitedly. \"Woof! Ready for hyper-speed!\" he barked, his voice a series of cheerful beeps and boops.\n\nThey both enjoyed the quiet moments before the next big adventure, but their peace didn’t last long. Suddenly, a faint sound crackled through the ship’s speakers. \"Beep... boop...\" It was a weak signal, like a tiny space hiccup. Captain Stellar tilted her head, listening intently. \"Did you hear that, Zoom?\" she asked.\n\n\"Woof! Beep boop?\" Zoom tilted his head too, his digital ears perked up. The Captain adjusted the ship's sensors, focusing on the source of the sound. The view screen showed a small, purple figure floating amidst the colorful gas clouds of the nebula. It was an alien, with big, worried eyes, and he looked incredibly lost. \"Well, I'll be!\" Captain Stellar exclaimed. \"A space traveler in need of assistance!\" She quickly steered the ship closer.\n\nAs the Stardust Skipper approached, the alien trembled and made the sound again. \"Beep boop?\" Zoom whined softly in sympathy. Captain Stellar leaned toward the viewscreen and spoke gently. \"Ahoy there, little one! Don’t you worry, we’re here to help,\" she said. Zoom then barked loudly once and then quietly whimpered, trying to show he was there to help too. Zorp, the little alien, just stared at them with wide, unsure eyes.",

He looked at Captain Stellar and then at Zoom, letting out a series of soft beeps. “Beep boop… beep… boop?” he said, his voice trembling. It was clear he was very scared and didn't know how to get home.\n\n“Ahoy there, space traveler!” Captain Stellar said gently, kneeling down so he was at Zorp’s level. “Don’t you worry, little friend. We’ll help you find your way back home. What was that language you were speaking, if you don't mind my asking?”\n\nZorp let out another series of beeps and boops, sounding a little more confused this time. Captain Stellar smiled kindly. “Right then, let’s see…”\n\nSuddenly, Zoom started wagging his tail excitedly. “Woof! Ready for hyper-speed!” he barked, and then he did something amazing. He started to glow, his metal plates shifted and rearranged themselves with a series of whirs and clicks, and in a matter of seconds, Zoom the robot dog transformed into a sleek, shiny spaceship! Zorp’s big eyes went even wider, and he let out a surprised “Beep!”\n\nCaptain Stellar chuckled. “Surprised, are you? Zoom here is no ordinary robot dog! He’s also our very own speedy spaceship! Now we can get to your home planet in no time.”\n\n“Woof! Engage hyper-speed!” Zoom barked, the spaceship's engines starting to hum. Captain Stellar clapped his hands together. “Hyper-speed, you see, is when we travel really, REALLY fast, faster than the speed of light even! It will feel a little like floating, and it will be a bit bumpy!”\n\nCaptain Stellar helped Zorp inside the Zoom-spaceship. Zorp, though still a bit nervous, was starting to feel hopeful. Zoom’s transformation had been so amazing! He was excited to see where they would go.\n\nCaptain Stellar settled into his seat. “Alright then, everyone ready? Let’s set a course for… well, that’s what we need from you Zorp! Where is home?”\n\nZorp looked around at his new friends. He felt a little better, with a gentle nod and a few tentative beeps, he pointed with one small finger towards a bright, swirling nebula in the distance. It was time for an adventure!",

The spaceship zoomed forward, colorful nebulae whizzing past the windows. \"This is amazing!\" Captain Stellar shouted, marveling at the vibrant space outside. Suddenly, they encountered a cluster of space debris – old asteroids and broken satellites spinning every which way. Zoom skillfully dodged and weaved through the obstacle course. \"Hold on tight!\" Zoom's robotic voice buzzed with excitement. After some thrilling twists and turns they were through. \"Whew, that was close!\" Captain Stellar laughed, patting Zoom’s control panel. \n\nFinally, after a good long fly, they reached a beautiful, blue-and-green planet. \"Beep boop! Home!\" Zorp squealed happily, their little body wiggling with joy. As they landed, they were greeted by a crowd of Zorp's friendly-looking, bouncy alien family members. \n\nZorp turned to Captain Stellar and Zoom, their big eyes shimmering. \"Beep boop! Thank you! Thank you!\" they exclaimed, giving both of them a big, tentacle hug. \"You're very welcome, Zorp!\" Captain Stellar said, smiling kindly. \"Woof! We’re happy we could help!\" Zoom added, wagging his metallic tail. Captain Stellar ruffled Zoom's head. \"We should get going, pal,\" she said. \"We have other space travelers to help!\" Zoom wagged his tail enthusiastically. \"Woof! Adventure calls!\"\n\nWith one last wave, Zoom soared back into space, leaving Zorp safely with their family.
